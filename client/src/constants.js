      "Well I must say, Zagreb is worth visiting. I had a beautiful time there, traveled through the streets of Zagreb and met new people ,explored cool places. My memories of Zagreb range from my new kicks, two beautiful picturesque apartments that I lived in, the majestic opera house, the line of bars at Tkalčićeva street and having one too many beers at my favourite bar there. The Museum of broken relationships made me cry, and the funicular that took me from the lower town to the upper town made me squeal with delight. The city stayed with me and it was a beautiful place to spend some time in Autumn.Upper town or Gornji Grad,Zagreb in Zagreb comprises of beautiful pastel coloured houses and narrow windy alleyways that lead you to beautiful squares and spectacular viewing points of the town below. Gornji Grad houses all the architectural delights like St. Mark’s church with its spectacular rooftop colours, the expansive St. Mark’s square, the Croatian Parliament Building, the quaint Stone Gate, the Zagreb City Museum, the Cathedral of Zagreb well known for its twin towers and the Dolac Market.",

      "Vienna is ok for day trips, especially if you are staying in Bratislava because Bratislava it is much cheaper. 9.2 euros return & the trains run every hour till late. 6 euros gets you a 24hour ticket on the efficient public transport system. keep your wits about you on the u bahn, not the best place to look like a tourist especially at karlplatz where drunks and smackheads seem congregate. walk like you know where you are going, even if you don't! Belvedre palace & schonnbrun palace are the opitomy of 18th century excesses, personally i found them vulgar and about as classy as the ultravox video! For fans of graham greenes' the third man then the volkspark is a must.Personally, i had more fun walking from the edge of bratislava through the borders into austria & hungary. although open, it still has a sense of forboding especially when you see the old watchtowers in th distance!",

      "We have just returned from a 13-day South American cruise, with two days in Rio. We pre-arranged (from Toronto) a tour of Rio with Manu Peclat for four adults to see all the attractions. We were very excited to be in this beautiful city, and Manu was waiting for us when we disembarked our cruise ship. We spent the next 12 hours in his company and had an amazing time. He spoke perfect english which was refreshing, since we had language issues, even with the use of a phrase book. As we enjoyed the comfort of an air-conditioned van, Manu personalized and customized our day. He took us not only to the typical sites - Sugar Loaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer but also to the lesser known sites where typically tourists would NOT go. The cable car ride in Santa Teresa was unique. The Carioca Aqueduct, a colonial structure that used to bring water to the centre of Rio, was converted into a bridge for The Santa Teresa Historic Tramway (bondinho). The old tram is the only one in Rio - and starts in the city centre, near the Largo da Carioca square, crosses the old aqueduct and goes through the picturesque streets of the neighbourhood with wonderful views of the city looking downhill. While in this area we were taken to the Mineiro Bar where we enjoyed Atlantica Maltzbiere and Paschtal - little turnover pastries filled with either black bean, cheese/mushroom or shrimp. Totally yummy! Another terrific stop was at the beautiful olde worlde Confeitaria Colombo. As we walked into The Colombo Coffee House, (built in 1884) we felt as if we'd gone back in time - it was exquisite. The decor, service and charm were wonderful. We had coffee and light pastries which were absolutely delicious. We were very glad to have made the stop and it was well worth the visit - especially if you're a caffeineaholic! Manu then took us to see Sugar Loaf - at night. What a spectacular view and unique experience.At the end of the day we were tired, but completely satisfied we had seen everything we had planned to. In fact we had such a good time, we asked him to meet us again the next day to go back to Ipanema Beach, Copacabana Beach and of course for some souvenir shopping! We highly recommend Manu as a guide - we felt totally safe and comfortable with him at all times - he was very friendly and reliable and even took some great pictures!",

      "It pains me to write this, because I love Rio and have often visited. But it is a very dangerous city, and you should not forget this. Tonight, i had a terrible, and I fear typical, experience. I was walking on Ipamena beach at 9 p.m. -- IPANEMA, the most tourist-friendly beach in Rio -- and was robbed by a group of knife-wielding teenagers at 9 p.m. There were plenty of people around as I was surrounded by these teenage thugs, who pushed me down and tried to grab everything out of pockets. I screamed help me, but no one came to my assistance. The gang got the I-Phone out of my pocket, although not my wallet (thank goodness). I tried to run and catch the gang, but again, despite my cries of stop them, no one helped me. It was very dis-spiriting, if only because the Cariocas nearby seemed to believe there was nothing to be gained -- and much to be risked -- by helping out this poor, dumb western tourist who had dared walk the most famous beach in Rio in the evening. I went the police station. And while the police officer was very nice, her only guidance was to stay in my hotel at night. Rio is too dangerous after dark, was her guidance. Very sad.",

      "Well having got back from 2 weeks in Rio last week now is the time for the usual report.Flights with Heathrow to GIG with B.A. No problems at Terminal 5. 11hr flight. GIG airport is a bit basic to say the least. ATM’s located on top floor but I nearly had a heart attack when my card kept getting rejected. I must have tried about 8 different machines. This is a recurring theme I had throughout the holiday. You have to look for ATM’s with Cirrus symbols on them (if you are using VISA). The majority of ATM’s do not have this. Look for Citibank and Banco Do Brasil (not all machines).I was determined to just hail a normal cab from outside the airport (personally I found most taxis to be trustworthy (apart from the odd one who tries to go round the houses or put you on tarifa 2 instead of 1..but the difference works out to be minimal) and the radio cabs in my opinion are uneccesary from the airport) but as figures I had researched had varied somewhat I wasn’t sure what I should be haggling towards. In the end I was approached by a driver who sweet talked me (I was tired and he started talking about David Beckham) and we agreed a figure of 65R$ to Ipanema. I found out that this is about 10/15R too high. Anyway got to the hotel in one piece.Hotel Sol Ipanema is a nice enough hotel right on the beach with roof top dip pool but costs about 360R$ + tax a night. This is stupidly expensive for what you get. This is not a criticism of this particular hotel but Rio in general which is the most expensive latin-american country I have visited thus far.Ipanema itself is a great base whilst in Rio and was safe enough to walk about until about 10pm (maybe even after this time but we were getting taxis). Plenty of people strolling about with mobiles and Ipods so you shouldn’t feel paranoid about whipping your camera out discreetly. Lets say the people living here have a few Reals to rub together.Ipanema beach is lovely and clean but the waves are strong. Be aware of red warning signs by the Postos when currents are strong.As my friend was on business we ended up getting taxis to most places which are quite reasonable. Centro is quite cool and is really bustling midweek. Ate at a place call Sabor on a pedestrian walkway near the dock and down from the Candelaria church. Even if the weather is not so good (which is surprisingly often) a stroll about is quite interesting.Nightime in Rio is quite cool as well. First big night we had was in Leblon. Started at Academia de Cahaca (nice hustle and bustle and you feel like one of the locals) and then walked down to the seafront and had Chopes in all the little bottequins on the way. Interesting to compare pubs in the U.K. to brazilian bottequins. They feel so much more full of life in Rio and all the families and friends are out together chatting away. In the balmy air there is a really nice ambience. Ended up in Melt. Quite pricey. Pumping House music and a young well heeled crowd. Be aware that you get given a card with you entrance fee and consumption marked as you go. God knows what happens if you go a bit crazy and drink more then you can afford. Maybe they just drive you up to Rocinha and drop you off dressed up as a military policeman Second big night was in Lapa. It sure is a crazy place and the complete opposite of Leblon. It certainly feels a lot grimier (but not in a bad way) loads of stalls selling drinks and food and people milling about. Saw some amazing live samba under the arches. Certainly a lot of strung out characters but we had our eyes open so no problems. Ended up in Cine 50 (I think that is the name) off the main drag that is the site of a former cinema converted into a club (they still had the original chairs around the edges). They played a mix of Beatles and Tropicalia. Awesome, good value night and we were the only gringos in there.In terms of the big sights Sugarloaf and Christ the Redeemer or no brainers. All I would say is that you really need to go on a clear early morning to see Cristo as it almost always clouds over at the summit (thus making it a waste of time). Even going early I was a bit disappointed with the view as it was quite hazy. Believe it or not the first time we went there we were massively hung over. We saw the huge queue and thought it would be best to go back to bed. My friend never did get round to going up!!! Sugarloaf is best at sundown and is pretty in its own way..again weather is everything.Football wise I managed to catch 2 games. One of those was Flamengo v Botafogo 1-0 (cr*p game, no atmosphere, stadium half empty). The other was a top of table clash against Palmeiras (awesome game, stadium virtually full). First time we were a bit worried and got a cab straight there 25R$. Some characters milling about but got our zona blanco neutral tickets (where the neutrals family go, not all the booths sell those tickets and I didn’t think it was that clearly marked) for 50R$ each. The ticket booths are funny. You have to get down on your knees and the slot is just big enough to put your hand in. This must stop the dubious characters from holdng up the attendants. Compared to the likes of Wembley or Emirates the Maracana is nothing to write home about but it is the atmosphere that makes it. Don’t expect them all to be great though. Most of the decent brazilian play in Europe. You can get there by metro as well. Station right next to the ground and fairly painless and safe enough. Oh and if you are after a football that isn’t Flamengo. You can forget it. Go to the night market at Copacabana for that.Regarding safety in general I felt safe walking around during the day in Centro, Botafogo, Flamengo, Leblon, Ipanema and Barra (described as the Miami of Brazil in LP, that is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard, apart from big shopping malls the place is a bit of a dirty hard to navigate hole). I pretty much avoided Copcabana after dark after hearing all the stories but it didn’t look too bad to be honest My initial paranoia mellowed to a relaxed state after a couple of days. It always pays to keep your eyes open and valuables in the hotel room though.Spent 4 days down the coast in Parati which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Rio and a good base to check the fantastic countryside and beaches. Got a bus with Costa Verde from Rodoviaria. Took about 4.5hrs. Pretty scenic ride. Parati is a unique town of cobblestone streets and colonial buildings. There are more pousadas then you can shake a stick at so plenty of options. After an initial night at one we didn’t like (can’t remember the name) we opted for the Porto Imperial which was a bit upmarket to be honest (not my choice). Was about 300R$ a night. It was a good decision as the place is fantastic. Great bar/breakfast area, beautiful pool. Games room. Felt a bit like a colonial hacienda.Had more trouble getting money out. All ATM’s rejected our cards until we found the Banco Do Brasil ATM with Cirrus sign (there is only one in the branch) Phew!Beware some high entrance fees. Ended up paying 40R$ for 2 caipirinhas at Paraty 33 once entrance fee was included. Nothing advising there was an entrance fee when we went in. Some O.k bars in the middle square but it was a little dead when we went there. Off season and during the weak. I’m sure it is a little better at the weekend. Ate a few nights at Sabor Da Terra, great por kilo restaurant just outside the centre. Tasty and good value. Just down the road there was a little self-service free ice cream place with loads of different flavours/toppings which was always empty but recommendable.We had a bit of bad luck with the weather as it was mostly overcast during the time there but nevertheless we hopped on a local bus to Penha and went to Cachoiera Toboga natural waterfalls. Truly a unique experience. In the jungle nature had carved a natural waterslide. A river flows over a huge rock face that is slippery with algae and has turned into a waterslide. Some of the locals were even doing some type of “rock surfing” sliding down to the pool at the bottom on their feet. It has to be seen to be believed.Next day other local bus took us to Trindade a fantastic collection of beaches that culminate in the Praia Caudaxo a naturally formed swimming pool in the ocean that is formed by massive boulders which are a feature of this area. A emerald green pool back by lush hilled rain-forest. On a sunny day it is beautiful. I think we went back to Rock n Beach where the bars belt out Bob Marley whilst you can enjoy the beverage of your choice as you watch the surfers. A wonderful place.We also took a schooner tour. This only cost 20R$. You pay extra for equipment and food, drinks. We were taken on a lovely boat to a few coves. Shame it wasn’t a sunny day as I could imagine it would have been that much better. You can dive off the boat and check out the jungle backed beaches which were pretty cool. Snorkeling was a bit lame really…a few fish and visibility wasn’t so hot but it might have been better on a sunny day. Certainly worth a trip out to see the islands anyway but pick a sunny day if you have achoice (you might not as they don’t call it the Costa Verde for nothing).Misc: With Spanish you can kind of get by ordering things and getting from A to B but you will struggle with in depth conversations. English is not widely spoken so gringos may have to resort to hand signals.We were stopped twice by police in Ipanema whilst in taxis. Once was quite early 10pm one was late 4am. Both times we were searched and my heart sank. I thought we would be asked for a cervejina or worse have one of the guys pop a little cocaine in our pockets. The thought of few nights in a Brazilian jail was not on my pre-trip itinerary. Both times I think they were looking to bust us for drugs. Seriously do not even think about it. In Lapa no doubt you could get hold of us stuff but the risks are huge.",
    summary:
      "Well having got back from 2 weeks in Rio last week now is the time for the usual report, you will see everything in story. Anyways that’s tapping from me. Rio (and it surroundings) are a great place to visit. Pack lots of money and your common sense and you will have a great time.",

      "I returned last night from a week-long vacation in Mexico City. My trip unintentionally, but fortuitously, coincided with Día de los Muertos. I stayed at Sofitel Mexico City Reforma. The hotel is conveniently located in the center of the city. It has spectacular views and excellent customer service. The hotel's staff enforced the necessary safety measures to keep its guest safe and healthy. For what it's worth, it is located next to the American Embassy. I lived in New York City for five years and, possibly as a result, I never felt unsafe in Mexico City. I took Ubers everywhere and all of the drivers wore masks and often had hand sanitizer near the back seat.I visited numerous art museums, toured a few historical homes, and ate at numerous cafes and restaurants. In regards to art museums, I highly recommend Anahuacalli Museum, Museo Frida Kahlo, Museo Nacional de Arte, Museo Soumaya, and Pallacio de Bellas Artes. Museo Frida Kahlo is a must-see and admission entitles you to admission at Anahuacalli Museum, Diego Rivera's museum of pre-Hispanic artifacts. I cannot stress enough the importance of purchasing your tickets in advance online for the Museo Frida Kahlo. The line was very short, but there were people without tickets and they were told to purchase their tickets online for the following day.In regards to historical homes, I highly recommend Casa de la Bola and Casa Gilardi. Casa de la Bola was probably built in the 1800s and was last occupied by Antonio Haghenbeck from the early 1940s until his death in the early 1990s. The house is grand, furnished lavishly, and has a beautiful tropical garden. Casa Gilardi is the last home designed by architect, Luis Barragán. It was completed in 1976. It is airy and bright.Finally, I highly recommend Salve Casa Niza and Cafe Nin for coffee and pastries. I highly recommend Arango, Azul, Carmela y Sal, Huset and Limosneros. I had some incredible street food too.No trip to Mexico City would be complete without a visit to Churrería El Moro for churros, Pastelería Ideal for pastries, and a day trip to Teotihuacán.Please feel free to ask me questions if you're considering a trip to Mexico City or if you have one planned.",
